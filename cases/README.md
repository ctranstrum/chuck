# One Up Chuck Cases

## Keyboard case files

If you have access to your own 3D printer with a large print bed
or if you are sending the files away to be printed,
you will want to use the full size cases:

- [bottom_case.stl](bottom_case.stl)
- [top_case.stl](top_case.stl)

If you have access to your own 3D printer
but it has a print bed too small for the full-size case,
you can print the 3-part top case:

- [top_dovetail_left.stl](top_dovetail_left.stl)
- [top_dovetail.stl](top_dovetail.stl)
- [top_dovetail_right.stl](top_dovetail_right.stl)

I don't know exactly why, but in my slicer software the right side
displays correctly, but then it tries to print it "inside out".

If this happens to you as well, you may have better luck with this file:

- [top-dovetail-right-fixed.stl](top-dovetail-right-fixed.stl)

## Encoder knobs

I had a hard time finding encoder knobs that I liked.
Ideally, you should get a knob for a low-profile EC12 encoder,
but all the ones I found were extra small,
and I wanted one a little bigger.

The keyboard was designed with the idea of using a 25mm diameter knob,
but I couldn't find any that size that were made for the EC12.
If you know of one, I'd be happy to learn about it.

In the meantime, I put a super-simple knob here for you to use.

After experimenting a bit, I found I preferred a 15mm tall knob,
but a 10mm knob seems to match the height of the keycaps,
if you like that, and a 13mm knob also seems usable.

- [encoder_knob-15mm.stl](encoder_knob-15mm.stl)
- [encoder_knob-13mm.stl](encoder_knob-13mm.stl)
- [encoder_knob-10mm.stl](encoder_knob-10mm.stl)
